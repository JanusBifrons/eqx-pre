# Ship Builder Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the test plan for verifying all ship builder fixes have been successfully implemented.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Hover Effect Stops Working After Placing First Piece ‚úÖ
**Root Cause**: Preview state wasn't properly maintained after block placement.

**Fix Applied**: 
- Modified `handleLeftClick()` to keep block selected after placement
- Added `refreshPreview()` call after successful placement
- Enhanced block type switching to immediately update preview position

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to Ship Builder page
2. Select a block type from the palette
3. Hover over the grid - should see preview block with colored indicator
4. Click to place the block
5. Continue hovering - preview should still work
6. Place multiple blocks - hover should work throughout

**Expected Result**: Hover preview continues working after placing blocks.

### 2. Block Deselection After Placement ‚úÖ  
**Root Cause**: Code was calling `deselectBlockType()` after each placement.

**Fix Applied**: 
- Removed `deselectBlockType()` call from `handleLeftClick()`
- Implemented "continuous building" behavior
- Block stays selected for multiple placements

**Test Steps**:
1. Select a block type
2. Place a block
3. Block type should remain selected (highlighted in palette)
4. Can immediately place another block without reselecting

**Expected Result**: Block type remains selected after placement for continuous building.

### 3. UI Statistics Don't Update ‚úÖ
**Root Cause**: UI components weren't receiving notifications when ship changed.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added callback system to `ShipBuilderRefactored`
- Bridge callbacks to React EventEmitter in `ShipBuilderAdapter`
- UI components listen for events and update accordingly

**Test Steps**:
1. Note initial stats (should show 0 blocks)
2. Place blocks of different types
3. Stats panel should update immediately showing:
   - Total blocks count
   - Block type counts
   - Mass calculations
   - Other ship statistics

**Expected Result**: Stats update in real-time as blocks are placed.

### 4. Block Type Switching Breaks Hover Effects ‚úÖ
**Root Cause**: Preview wasn't properly updating when switching between block types.

**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced `selectBlockType()` to update preview position immediately
- Fixed indicator lifecycle management in `BlockPreview`
- Added mouse position tracking for instant preview updates

**Test Steps**:
1. Select block type A
2. Hover over grid (should see type A preview)
3. Switch to block type B without moving mouse
4. Preview should immediately switch to type B at current mouse position
5. Continue hovering and switching types
6. Indicators should properly update colors and shapes

**Expected Result**: Switching block types immediately updates preview without requiring mouse movement.

## Critical Bug Fixes

### Null Pointer Exception in BlockPreview ‚úÖ
**Issue**: `this.indicator` was null causing runtime crashes.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added null checks in `updateIndicatorColor()`
- Fixed indicator lifecycle management
- Ensured indicator is always properly initialized

**Test Steps**:
1. All hover operations should work without console errors
2. Check browser console for any null pointer exceptions
3. Switch between block types rapidly

**Expected Result**: No runtime errors or crashes.

## Additional Features Implemented

### Debug Logging üîß
**Purpose**: Added comprehensive logging for troubleshooting.

**Test Steps**:
1. Open browser console
2. Perform ship builder operations
3. Should see detailed logs with prefixes:
   - `üéØ ShipBuilder:` for main operations
   - `üîÑ BlockPreview:` for preview operations
   - `‚ö†Ô∏è` for warnings
   - `‚ùå` for errors

**Note**: Debug logging should be removed once all issues are confirmed resolved.

### Mouse Position Tracking ‚úÖ
**Purpose**: Enables immediate preview updates when switching block types.

**Test Steps**:
1. Move mouse over grid
2. Switch block types without moving mouse
3. Preview should update at current mouse position

## Manual Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Can navigate to Ship Builder page
- [ ] Block palette loads and displays available blocks
- [ ] Can select different block types
- [ ] Grid renders properly
- [ ] Camera controls work (pan, zoom)

### Core Issues Testing
- [ ] **Issue 1**: Hover effects continue working after placing blocks
- [ ] **Issue 2**: Block types remain selected after placement
- [ ] **Issue 3**: UI statistics update when blocks are placed
- [ ] **Issue 4**: Block type switching immediately updates preview

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Rapid block type switching
- [ ] Placing blocks near grid boundaries
- [ ] Placing blocks on occupied spaces
- [ ] Zoom in/out while hovering
- [ ] Pan camera while hovering

### Error Handling
- [ ] No console errors during normal operation
- [ ] Invalid placements show appropriate indicators
- [ ] Out-of-bounds placements handled gracefully

## Performance Testing
- [ ] No noticeable lag when switching block types
- [ ] Smooth hover effects
- [ ] UI updates are responsive
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during extended use

## Browser Testing
Test in multiple browsers to ensure compatibility:
- [ ] Chrome
- [ ] Firefox  
- [ ] Safari (if available)
- [ ] Edge

## Cleanup Tasks (Post-Testing)
Once all tests pass:
- [ ] Remove debug console logging
- [ ] Update documentation with final implementation details
- [ ] Consider adding automated tests for regression prevention

## Success Criteria
All tests in this plan should pass without any errors or unexpected behavior. The ship builder should provide a smooth, intuitive building experience with immediate feedback and proper state management.
