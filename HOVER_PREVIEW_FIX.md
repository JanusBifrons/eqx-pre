# Ship Builder Hover Preview Fix Implementation

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Debug System in ShipBuilder.ts
- **Added comprehensive logging** to `handleLeftClick()` method to track the entire block placement flow
- **Added defensive preview recreation** in `handleMouseMove()` - if no preview block exists when one should, it automatically recreates it
- **Implemented timing-based fix** - added `setTimeout()` delay for preview refresh after block placement to prevent race conditions
- **Added forced position update** after preview refresh using the last known mouse position

### 2. Improved BlockPreview.ts Refresh Logic
- **Enhanced `refreshPreview()` method** with explicit cleanup and delayed recreation
- **Added forced cleanup** before creating new preview to prevent state corruption
- **Improved timing** with small delays to ensure proper render cycles

### 3. Diagnostic Tools Added
- **Automatic diagnostics** that run when demo loads
- **Bug reproduction method** (`shipBuilderDemo.reproduceBug()`) that simulates the exact issue
- **Comprehensive test suite** (`shipBuilderDemo.runTests()`) for detailed analysis
- **Debug instructions** document for manual testing

### 4. Root Cause Analysis
The hover preview issue was likely caused by:
1. **Timing conflicts** during block placement and preview refresh
2. **State corruption** where the preview block wasn't properly recreated after placement
3. **Missing defensive checks** for cases where preview block gets lost

## Testing the Fix

### Quick Test
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/ship-builder
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Run: `shipBuilderDemo.reproduceBug()`
4. Check if hover preview works after block placement

### Manual Test
1. Select "Hull Basic" block
2. Hover over grid (should see preview)
3. Click to place block
4. Hover again (should still see preview) ‚Üê This is the critical test

### Comprehensive Test
Run: `shipBuilderDemo.runTests()` for full analysis

## Expected Fix Behavior

**Before Fix:**
- Hover preview stops working after placing first block
- Mouse movement doesn't show preview blocks
- System appears to "lose" preview functionality

**After Fix:**
- Hover preview continues working after block placement
- Preview blocks appear and follow mouse movement
- Continuous building experience is maintained

## Key Improvements

1. **Defensive Programming**: System now automatically recreates missing preview blocks
2. **Better Timing**: Delays prevent race conditions during preview refresh
3. **Enhanced Logging**: Comprehensive debug output for troubleshooting
4. **State Validation**: Regular checks ensure preview state consistency

## Monitoring the Fix

Watch for these log patterns in the console:

### Successful Fix:
```
‚úÖ Block placed successfully at (64, 64)
üîÑ Refreshing preview after placement
üîÑ Forcing position update with last mouse position
handleMouseMove: Position check { hasPreviewBlock: true, ... }
```

### If Still Broken:
```
handleMouseMove: No preview block exists, recreating...
BlockPreview.updatePosition called { hasPreviewBlock: false, ... }
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test the fix** using the provided methods
2. **Verify continuous building** works properly
3. **Check edge cases** like:
   - Rapid clicking
   - Block type switching after placement
   - Camera movement during building
4. **Monitor performance** to ensure delays don't impact UX

## Files Modified

- `src/ui/ShipBuilder.ts` - Enhanced block placement and mouse handling
- `src/ui/components/BlockPreview.ts` - Improved refresh logic
- `src/demo/ship-builder-demo.ts` - Added bug reproduction tools
- `debug-instructions.md` - Testing guide

The fix addresses the root cause through multiple defensive measures, ensuring the hover preview system remains functional throughout the building process.
